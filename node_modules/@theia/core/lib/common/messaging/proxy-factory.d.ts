 * A RPC proxy exposes the programmatic interface of an object through
 * Theia's RPC protocol. This allows remote programs to call methods of this objects by
 * sending RPC requests. This takes place over a bi-directional stream,
 * where both ends can expose an object and both can call methods on each other'
 * exposed object.
 *
 * For example, assuming we have an object of the following type on one end:
 *
 *     class Foo {
 *         bar(baz: number): number { return baz + 1 }
 *     }
 *
 * which we want to expose through a RPC interface.  We would do:
 *
 *     let target = new Foo()
 *     let factory = new RpcProxyFactory<Foo>('/foo', target)
 *     factory.onConnection(connection)
 *
 * The party at the other end of the `connection`, in order to remotely call
 * methods on this object would do:
 *
 *     let factory = new RpcProxyFactory<Foo>('/foo')
 *     factory.onConnection(connection)
 *     let proxy = factory.createProxy();
 *     let result = proxy.bar(42)
 *     // result is equal to 43
 *
 * One the wire, it would look like this:
 *
 *     --> { "type":"1", "id": 1, "method": "bar", "args": [42]}
 *     <-- { "type":"3", "id": 1, "res": 43}
 *
 * Note that in the code of the caller, we didn't pass a target object to
 * RpcProxyFactory, because we don't want/need to expose an object.
 * If we had passed a target object, the other side could've called methods on
 * it.
 *
