    * The report is hidden until the Generate Report button is clicked for the first time
    
    * cannot set the start date of the harvest report ot be after the end data and vice vera. They can be set to the same data though

    * the dropdown slection on the crop will now help spefify which logs are added to the table
    
    * added html file called transplanting and it has a heading: Transplanting Report
    
    * added subtab called transplanting that connects to the transplanting.html file
    
    * Intialized Vue variable and added a div section: Transplanting report
    
    * table created for data insertion
    
    * took out spike subtabs in FD2 Example tab
    
    * added input for start date. This input changes the startDate varaible in Vue.js to the inputed date.
    
    * A date input was added for the user to add an End date for their desired range. The input is saved into the endDate variable in Vue.js. A max for the start date and a min for the end date was added. These were linked to each other.
    
    * added a field variable to store all fields and a drop down list of field for selection
    
    * Now when the generate button is hit the instnace that appear in Vue.js from the data are only after the start date that was inputed
    
    In order for this to be created, a Generate Report button, a logs variable in Vue.js, and a saveLogs method was created. When the Generate report button is cicked the saveLogs method is started. In the saved logs method a variable called link is created. This variable is set to the standard link for all transplanting log. Then if startDate is not empty then the link variable is added to inorder to create a link that will get all transplanting logs created after that start date. Then that link is used in the axios call. In order to do this, the methodstimestampToYMD and YMDToTimestamp were created. This methods change YMD time to timestamp time and vice versa.
    
    * the variable endDate now effects what logs show up in the Vue.js logs.
    
    In the saveLogs method, if the endDate variable is not empty. The link varibale is added to, so that the link will only call transplanting logs that happened before that date.
    
    * Added crop name filtering to the table
    
    * added varaibles rowfeet and rowbed to each log. These variables find the row feet and row/bed data from each log.
    
    * Added bed feet to the transplanting table.
    
    In order to do this, a calculate bed feet method was required. This took in the row feet and rowbed data. It used the methods getRowFeet and getRowBed to seperate the number from the rest of the data. It then divided row feet by rowbed to get bed feet
    
    * Table displays rows/bed now
    
    * Added user that created the report to the table
    
    * Deleted test message from transplanting page
    
    * this story added the comment to the table.
    
    it did this by accessing the notes in the logs and printing the information in the value key of the notes array
    
    * reversed the rowPerBed and rowFeet in the table. There were in the wrong place
